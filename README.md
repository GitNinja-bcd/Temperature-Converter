The player chooses between two sides either 'banker' or 'player'. After drawing two cards the one who has the nearest number to 9 wins.

Whenever the sum is overboard to 9, 1 card will be drawn from the deck. However if at the first two draw results are a sum of 8 and 9, the dealer won't draw additional cards anymore.
